							<h1 class="major">Artificial Inventory</h1>
							<h2 class ="">The project</h2>
							<p>We developed a system for the Software Fair USM 2020, where by using the real time footage from the security cameras, we could detect empty spaces on shelves and people inside the store.</p>
							<p>All this was made possible thanks to convolutional neural networks.</p>
							<h2>Detection</h2>
							<p>The empty spaces detection was made by a technique called segmentation, in wich we would tell exactly how empty spaces would look like to the neural network.</p>
							<p>With this information was possible to tell the percentage of missing products and where it was located.</p>

							<p>On the other hand, for the people detection process, we used image object classification with convolutional neural networks, based on a pre-trained nn YOLO-V3 to detect people inside the store. </p>

							<h2>My job</h2>
							<p>For the correct functionality of this project was needed to make an api to communicate the neural network and all the backend process with the front.</p>
							<p>My job was to create the api and process the information given by the neural network and the cameras.</p>
